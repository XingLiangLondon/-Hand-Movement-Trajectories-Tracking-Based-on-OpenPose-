# Hand Movement Trajectories Tracking (Based on OpenPose Skeleton)
## Methodology
To utilise OpenPose library for hand movement trajectory tracking 
- Firstly please intall the tf-openpose model following the instructions of the link: https://github.com/ildoonet/tf-pose-estimation. Thanks to the amazing work of Ildoo Kim, that translated most code of the OpenPose Library to Python.  
- Then download the code for hand movenment tracking of this repository. Hopefully you will get the results as shown below. :wink:
